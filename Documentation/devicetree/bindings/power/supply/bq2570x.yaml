title: Battery driver for CW2015 shuntless fuel gauge by CellWise.

maintainers:
  - Yan <yan-wyb@foxmail.com>

description: |
  This driver will support the bq2570x and the bq25700. There are other ICs
  in the same family but those have not been tested.

  cellwise,battery-profile:
    description: |
      This property specifies characteristics of the battery used. The format
      of this binary blob is kept secret by CellWise. The only way to obtain
      it is to mail two batteries to a test facility of CellWise and receive
      back a test report with the binary blob.

    description:
      Specifies the interval in milliseconds gauge values are polled at
